Next generation of project lifecycle management system.  Intended to run on TomEE.

PaLM (Project Lifecycle Management) was initially created to manage the manufacturing
specifications of projects as they diverge from generic project types that are defined
in a three level nested hierarchy (category/line/group).

Originally created as an Java enterprise application following the 3.1 standard and
designed to run on Apache Geronimo (Tomcat) taking advantage of the Dojo JavaScript
library to manage the DOM on the browser and the AJAX communications back and forth
to the server. The database was stored in a MySQL server (using Apache OpenJPA).
